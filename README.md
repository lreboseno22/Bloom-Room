# SBA 316: The Document Object Model

## Bloom Room

A small garden simulator inspired by a game I actually play. You enter in by inputting your name and a password. Currently, the application only displays the username nothing more. Once you navigate to the main page which is your garden you must buy seeds from the Seed Shop. After doing so, you can select which seed you want to plant in the plots. Each plant has it's own growth stages so watch your lovely plants grow!


### Small Notes:

I'm aware there is a bug where if you remove a seed from your inventory, you can still pant seeds, I look forward to going back in my code and prevent this. In the future I would like to add a harvest button for the plants already grown and replace the natural growth which is set by a setInterval() with a watering can to speed up growth. There is also no currency but currently you can only buy one of each seed since they don't get used up when planting (I plan to change this). Overall this was a fun project and I would like to dabble in sound effects or more visual effects. 

## Reflection

What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?
- I realize I was missing out on some of the objectives for this project so some line changes of code might seem forced but next time I'll plan out more throughly where to implement certain logic so it's not added last second.

Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?
- Adding the "Use the parent-child-sibling relationship to navigate between elements at least once (firstChild, lastChild, parentNode, nextElementSibling, etc.)" was a bit difficult for me because I had already cached a lot of variables and couldn't seem to find a location to implement this without some of my code breaking.
